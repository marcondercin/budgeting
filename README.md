# Budgeting
_Currently in progress_

After trying out some budgeting software, I decided to try to make my own. 

## selenium_scraper
Using the selenium package, this script runs an instance of Chrome that navigates to bank pages through link text. At every account page it saves the page source to a file to be filtered through.

## bsoup
Uses the beautiful soup package to filter the html source and pull out transactions as useable data.
