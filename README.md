# Budgeting
After trying out some budgeting software, I decided to make my own.

## selenium_scraper
Using the selenium package, this script runs an instance of Chrome that navigates to bank pages through link text. At every account page it saves the page source to a file to be filtered through.

## bsoup
Uses the beautiful soup package to search through the html source and make it useable as data.
